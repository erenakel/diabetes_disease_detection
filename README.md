# Diabetes Disease Detection

This project focuses on **predicting diabetes** by comparing different machine learning models. **Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and XGBoost** are used to make predictions, and the best-performing model is selected.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**:  
  - The dataset used is **diabetes.csv**, which helps predict whether a Pima Indian woman has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.  
  - The dataset includes the following features:
    - Number of Pregnancies
    - Glucose Level
    - Blood Pressure
    - Skin Thickness
    - Insulin Level
    - Body Mass Index (BMI)
    - Diabetes Pedigree Function
    - Age

- **Methods Used**:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)  
  - XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)  

- **Comparison**:  
  - The performance of the three models is evaluated to determine the best one.  
  - **Error metrics, accuracy scores, and visualization techniques** are used for evaluation.  

## How to Run?

1. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tensorflow xgboost scikit-learn
   ```
2. Run the notebook to load the dataset and train the models.  

## Technologies Used

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**  
- **Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras)**
